sab_api

This script performs SABnzbd API calls as specified in the SABnzbd API
documentation. All currently defined API functions are supported by this
script. There is also the ability to easily return a query constructed
explicitly by the user without having to have the API key. This script can
also be used with included options to allow the user to construct a valid
API URL with/without accessing it. The script attempts to identify common
errors with input values when possible, but is not intended to completely
ensure that all API accesses are without flaw. The user should make use of
the script's troubleshooting features if an API access is not working
as expected.
