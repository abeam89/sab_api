sab_api

This bash script performs SABnzbd API calls as specified in the SABnzbd API
documentation. All currently defined API functions are supported by this
script. There is also the ability to easily return a query constructed
explicitly by the user without having to have the API key. This script can
also be used with included options to allow the user to construct a valid
API URL with/without accessing it. This could be useful to generate a URL to
use for a separate application. The script attempts to identify common
errors with input values when possible, but is not intended to completely
ensure that all API accesses are without flaw. The user should make use of
the script's troubleshooting features if an API access is not working
as expected.

Please note that there are no warranties of any kind, expressed or implied,
that are provided you as a result of using this script. In other words, if
you use this script and it destroys your SABnzbd queue or history or does
any other type of damage, it's not my fault. This applies to any outcome
of using this script that results in an undesireable impact, regardless of
the depth of that impact. But I'm sure you were already aware of this.

Seriously, though, I hope someone besides me finds this at least slightly
useful. I developed this as a bash script solely because I felt it would be
the quickest thing for me to do. If there are enough requests I might
consider implementing this in something like Python, but I figure for most
this will be perfectly sufficient.
